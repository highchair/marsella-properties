    <p>Our staff ensures that properties are in excellent physical condition at all times. Proper maintenance has a profound impact on the ability of current tenants to enjoy these spaces and it also attracts new tenants. We constantly seek innovative ways to control costs while increasing property value and maintaining the highest levels of tenant satisfaction and comfort. </p>

    <h2 class="h4 text-bold">Preventative Maintenance</h2>
    <p>A determination of preventative maintenance will be made by our Head of Operations and reviewed by the Director of Property Management. Once these needs are determined, a list of preventative maintenance tasks will be complied and assigned a frequency of occurrence. This information will be entered into Building Engines, our web based preventative maintenance system. </p>
