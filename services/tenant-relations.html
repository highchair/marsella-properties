    <p>Communication is a key element of building and maintaining a collaborative relationship. Marsella Propertiesâ€™ Managers will work to establish relationships with existing tenants on day one. Over the course of our work, we continually solicit feedback from tenants with one-on-one conversations. The follow-up is as important as the follow through as we ensure that any job was completed with total satisfaction. This communication provides a basis of trust and understanding between the property management team and the tenants. </p>
